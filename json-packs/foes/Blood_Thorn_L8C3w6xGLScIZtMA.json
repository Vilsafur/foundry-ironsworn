Then, it leeches their life through hollow thorns, eventually bleeding them dry.</p>\n<p>Blood thorns appear in woodland areas throughout the Ironlands. They are especially common in the Deep Wilds, where they often encircle elf villages. Some suspect they are cultivated by the elves, or share a symbiotic relationship with them.</p>\n\n<div class=\"boxgroup flexrow boxrow\">\n  <div class=\"flexcol box\" style=\"justify-content: flex-start;\">\n    <h4 class=\"nogrow\" style=\"margin: 0.5em;\">Features</h4>\n    <p class=\"nogrow\">Thorn-tipped branches</p>\n    <p class=\"nogrow\">Scattered bones, stripped clean</p>\n    <p class=\"nogrow\">Large central pod</p>\n  </div>\n  <div class=\"flexcol box\" style=\"justify-content: flex-start;\">\n    <h4 class=\"nogrow\" style=\"margin: 0.5em;\">Drives</h4>\n    <p class=\"nogrow\">Consume blood</p>\n    <p class=\"nogrow\">Proliferate</p>\n  </div>\n  <div class=\"flexcol box\" style=\"justify-content: flex-start;\">\n    <h4 class=\"nogrow\" style=\"margin: 0.5em;\">Tactics</h4>\n    <p class=\"nogrow\">Lie in wait</p>\n    <p class=\"nogrow\">Grasp, entangle, and feed</p>\n  </div>\n</div>\n\n<em><p>Ironlanders attempted to found a settlement at the heart of a <strong>Wild Tanglewood</strong> a decade ago.
