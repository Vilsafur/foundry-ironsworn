They regularly feed on marsh rats or deer, but will eagerly make a meal out of a passing Ironlander.</p>\n\n<div class=\"boxgroup flexrow boxrow\">\n  <div class=\"flexcol box\" style=\"justify-content: flex-start;\">\n    <h4 class=\"nogrow\" style=\"margin: 0.5em;\">Features</h4>\n    <p class=\"nogrow\">Giant snake</p>\n    <p class=\"nogrow\">Dull yellow-brown skin</p>\n    <p class=\"nogrow\">Vibrant yellow eyes</p>\n  </div>\n  <div class=\"flexcol box\" style=\"justify-content: flex-start;\">\n    <h4 class=\"nogrow\" style=\"margin: 0.5em;\">Drives</h4>\n    <p class=\"nogrow\">Devour</p>\n  </div>\n  <div class=\"flexcol box\" style=\"justify-content: flex-start;\">\n    <h4 class=\"nogrow\" style=\"margin: 0.5em;\">Tactics</h4>\n    <p class=\"nogrow\">Lay in wait</p>\n    <p class=\"nogrow\">Mesmerizing gaze</p>\n    <p class=\"nogrow\">Sudden bite</p>\n    <p class=\"nogrow\">Crush</p>\n  </div>\n</div>\n\n<em><p>The adventurer set out to slay a basilisk, only to become its next meal.
