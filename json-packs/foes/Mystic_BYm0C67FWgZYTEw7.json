They walk in two worlds, and their eyes shimmer with that dark reflection of realms beyond our own. We call it the sight. Some hold that darkness in check. Others are consumed by it.</p>\n\n<div class=\"boxgroup flexrow boxrow\">\n  <div class=\"flexcol box\" style=\"justify-content: flex-start;\">\n    <h4 class=\"nogrow\" style=\"margin: 0.5em;\">Features</h4>\n    <p class=\"nogrow\">Knowing eyes</p>\n    <p class=\"nogrow\">Tattooed skin</p>\n  </div>\n  <div class=\"flexcol box\" style=\"justify-content: flex-start;\">\n    <h4 class=\"nogrow\" style=\"margin: 0.5em;\">Drives</h4>\n    <p class=\"nogrow\">Respect the Old Ways</p>\n    <p class=\"nogrow\">Seek the paths of power</p>\n  </div>\n  <div class=\"flexcol box\" style=\"justify-content: flex-start;\">\n    <h4 class=\"nogrow\" style=\"margin: 0.5em;\">Tactics</h4>\n    <p class=\"nogrow\">Foresee the intent of my enemies</p>\n    <p class=\"nogrow\">Prepare rituals</p>\n    <p class=\"nogrow\">Use trickery</p>\n  </div>\n</div>\n\n<em><p>A mystic returns to their home after a years-long journey. They are changed. What new power or knowledge do now they wield? What do they seek to do with it? Why do you oppose them?</p></em>\n\n\n<h2>Ironlander</h2>\n<p>Ironlanders are the human inhabitants of these lands. Unless your story emphasizes adventures well outside of the settled regions, the majority of your interactions will be with fellow Ironlanders.</p>\n<p>This section covers a few broad categories of Ironlanders. They are not representative of the variety of people and cultures in these lands. When you are forced to fight an Ironlander and need to determine their rank, you can <em>Ask the Oracle</em>, or follow these guidelines:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p>A common citizen or brute is <strong>troublesome</strong>.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>A trained warrior is <strong>dangerous</strong>.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>A powerful or veteran warrior is <strong>formidable</strong>.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n",
