In their own language they are called the jokul.</p>\n<p>Many Ironlanders misinterpret their quiet nature for dullness, but giants are keenly intelligent and observant. They have a great respect for life, even for our kind, and will use trickery and negotiation to avoid a fight. When they are left without other options, an enraged giant is a devastating, relentless force.</p>\n\n<div class=\"boxgroup flexrow boxrow\">\n  <div class=\"flexcol box\" style=\"justify-content: flex-start;\">\n    <h4 class=\"nogrow\" style=\"margin: 0.5em;\">Features</h4>\n    <p class=\"nogrow\">Dark hair and ruddy skin</p>\n    <p class=\"nogrow\">Twice the size of a tall man, or more</p>\n    <p class=\"nogrow\">Wearing layers of wool, hide and furs</p>\n    <p class=\"nogrow\">Stoic and observant</p>\n  </div>\n  <div class=\"flexcol box\" style=\"justify-content: flex-start;\">\n    <h4 class=\"nogrow\" style=\"margin: 0.5em;\">Drives</h4>\n    <p class=\"nogrow\">Survive the winter</p>\n    <p class=\"nogrow\">Protect the herd</p>\n  </div>\n  <div class=\"flexcol box\" style=\"justify-content: flex-start;\">\n    <h4 class=\"nogrow\" style=\"margin: 0.5em;\">Tactics</h4>\n    <p class=\"nogrow\">Fight as a last resport</p>\n    <p class=\"nogrow\">Sweeping strike</p>\n    <p class=\"nogrow\">Make them flee</p>\n  </div>\n</div>\n\n<em><p>A pair of giants are raiding human settlements, stealing supplies and livestock. With winter coming, the survival of those settlements is threatened. What is driving the giants down from the hills?</p></em>\n\n<em><p>Every fifth spring, the giant clans meet for a gathering. There, the memory-keepers sing of a great giant hero, revered by all. Who is this hero?</p></em>\n\n<h2>Firstborn</h2>\n<p>The firstborn lived here long before the humans landed on these shores. The humans, in their arrogance, named this peninsula the Ironlands and called themselves Ironlandersâ€”but the firstborn gave it names of their own in a time beyond the reach of memory.</p>\n",
