They sometimes surface to hunt within shallower waters. They will indiscriminately destroy any Ironlander craft which stray to close to their hunting grounds.</p>\n<p>Watchful sailors might catch sight of a leviathan circling their boat, studying them, in the moments before it attacks. Their dagger-shaped head is as tough and destructive as any battering ram, able to shatter a ship in a single blow.</p>\n\n<div class=\"boxgroup flexrow boxrow\">\n  <div class=\"flexcol box\" style=\"justify-content: flex-start;\">\n    <h4 class=\"nogrow\" style=\"margin: 0.5em;\">Features</h4>\n    <p class=\"nogrow\">Massive bulk</p>\n    <p class=\"nogrow\">Flesh as tough as iron</p>\n    <p class=\"nogrow\">Cold black eyes</p>\n    <p class=\"nogrow\">Sinuous grace</p>\n  </div>\n  <div class=\"flexcol box\" style=\"justify-content: flex-start;\">\n    <h4 class=\"nogrow\" style=\"margin: 0.5em;\">Drives</h4>\n    <p class=\"nogrow\">Slumber in the depths</p>\n    <p class=\"nogrow\">Destroy those who trespass</p>\n  </div>\n  <div class=\"flexcol box\" style=\"justify-content: flex-start;\">\n    <h4 class=\"nogrow\" style=\"margin: 0.5em;\">Tactics</h4>\n    <p class=\"nogrow\">Rise from the depths</p>\n    <p class=\"nogrow\">Ram and swamp ships</p>\n    <p class=\"nogrow\">Devour prey whole</p>\n  </div>\n</div>\n\n<em><p>A leviathan lurks off the coast, preying on fishing boats and trade ships.
