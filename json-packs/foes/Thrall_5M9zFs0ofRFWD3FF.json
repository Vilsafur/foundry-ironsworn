    "description": "\n\n<h2>Thrall</h2>\n\n<p>A thrall is a living person controlled by the will of a powerful undead spirit. The malignant presence can lie dormant for some time, feeding on the suffering of the host and subtly manipulating them to achieve its mysterious and often malevolent ends. Once the host is weakened, the spirit supplants their will entirely.</p>\n\n<div class=\"boxgroup flexrow boxrow\">\n  <div class=\"flexcol box\" style=\"justify-content: flex-start;\">\n    <h4 class=\"nogrow\" style=\"margin: 0.5em;\">Features</h4>\n    <p class=\"nogrow\">Sickly countenance</p>\n    <p class=\"nogrow\">Glimpses of their true nature</p>\n    <p class=\"nogrow\">A clash of personalities</p>\n  </div>\n  <div class=\"flexcol box\" style=\"justify-content: flex-start;\">\n    <h4 class=\"nogrow\" style=\"margin: 0.5em;\">Drives</h4>\n    <p class=\"nogrow\">Endure beyond death</p>\n    <p class=\"nogrow\">Coerce and manipulate</p>\n    <p class=\"nogrow\">Stifle the will of the host</p>\n  </div>\n  <div class=\"flexcol box\" style=\"justify-content: flex-start;\">\n    <h4 class=\"nogrow\" style=\"margin: 0.5em;\">Tactics</h4>\n    <p class=\"nogrow\">Reveal their true self</p>\n    <p class=\"nogrow\">Lash out with unnatural strength</p>\n  </div>\n</div>\n\n<em><p>A spirit has taken possession of someone you care about. They are fading, and will soon be a thrall to its will. Within a <strong>Haunted Barrow</strong>, the spiritâ€™s remains lie entombed. What ritual must you enact there to banish this foul presence?</p></em>\n\n<em><p>To detect the presence of a spirit, drawing it out of the thrall for a few moments, mystics must perform a dangerous ritual. What is the nature of this ritual, and what rare or elusive component does it require?</p></em>\n\n<h2>Horror</h2>\n<p>Horrors are supernatural entities. In the Old World, they were superstition and legend. Here, they are nightmares made real. The Ironlands is fertile ground for darkness and evil to take hold, spawning these undead beings of pure vengeance or mindless hate.</p>\n<p>Many horrors can be temporarily defeated through physical attacks, but cannot be killed. They are beyond death.</p>\n",
