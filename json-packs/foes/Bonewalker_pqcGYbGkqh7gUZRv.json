    "description": "\n\n<h2>Bonewalker</h2>\n\n<p>Bonewalkers are human remains given unnatural life. The source of the dark energy that animates them is a mystery. Some say it is the will of dark gods. Some say an ancient evil permeates this land and seeps into porous bones of the dead. Or, perhaps it is the work of corrupt mystics.</p>\n<p>Bonewalkers usually roam the location of their final resting placeâ€”a burial site, a cursed battlefield, or a settlement blighted by disease or violence. Nothing remains of their previous selves. They are soulless monsters driven only to destroy the living.</p>\n\n<div class=\"boxgroup flexrow boxrow\">\n  <div class=\"flexcol box\" style=\"justify-content: flex-start;\">\n    <h4 class=\"nogrow\" style=\"margin: 0.5em;\">Features</h4>\n    <p class=\"nogrow\">Skeletal corpse</p>\n    <p class=\"nogrow\">Eye sockets glowing with a fetid red light</p>\n    <p class=\"nogrow\">Tattered remains of clothing and armor</p>\n  </div>\n  <div class=\"flexcol box\" style=\"justify-content: flex-start;\">\n    <h4 class=\"nogrow\" style=\"margin: 0.5em;\">Drives</h4>\n    <p class=\"nogrow\">Destroy life</p>\n  </div>\n  <div class=\"flexcol box\" style=\"justify-content: flex-start;\">\n    <h4 class=\"nogrow\" style=\"margin: 0.5em;\">Tactics</h4>\n    <p class=\"nogrow\">Rush with unexpected speed</p>\n    <p class=\"nogrow\">Attack with the weapons they bore in life</p>\n    <p class=\"nogrow\">Grasp and claw</p>\n  </div>\n</div>\n\n<em><p>A horde of bonewalkers marches relentlessly towards the Havens.

Here, they are nightmares made real. The Ironlands is fertile ground for darkness and evil to take hold, spawning these undead beings of pure vengeance or mindless hate.</p>\n<p>Many horrors can be temporarily defeated through physical attacks, but cannot be killed. They are beyond death.</p>\n",
