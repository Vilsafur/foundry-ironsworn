Drawn to the dead, and foretelling great doom, they are capable predators and grim messengers of death.</p>\n<p>They appear as gaunt, emaciated hounds, often mistaken for starving animals at first glance. Their fiendish form reveals itself in blood-red eyes, sweeping horns, and skin the texture of charred and blistered wood.</p>\n\n<div class=\"boxgroup flexrow boxrow\">\n  <div class=\"flexcol box\" style=\"justify-content: flex-start;\">\n    <h4 class=\"nogrow\" style=\"margin: 0.5em;\">Features</h4>\n    <p class=\"nogrow\">Red eyes</p>\n    <p class=\"nogrow\">Lean, hound-like form</p>\n    <p class=\"nogrow\">Curved horns</p>\n  </div>\n  <div class=\"flexcol box\" style=\"justify-content: flex-start;\">\n    <h4 class=\"nogrow\" style=\"margin: 0.5em;\">Drives</h4>\n    <p class=\"nogrow\">Portend death</p>\n    <p class=\"nogrow\">Fulfill the prophecy of death</p>\n    <p class=\"nogrow\">Lair in places where death is near</p>\n  </div>\n  <div class=\"flexcol box\" style=\"justify-content: flex-start;\">\n    <h4 class=\"nogrow\" style=\"margin: 0.5em;\">Tactics</h4>\n    <p class=\"nogrow\">Unearthly howl</p>\n    <p class=\"nogrow\">Piercing gaze</p>\n    <p class=\"nogrow\">Savage bite</p>\n  </div>\n</div>\n\n<em><p>Every night, a blighthound appears outside a settlement at the edge of a <strong>Wild Tanglewood</strong>, observing silently from within the mist. The people are gripped with a cold fear, wondering what fate will befall them. If any approach the blighthound, it leads them into the depths of the woods...</p></em>\n\n\n<h2>Horror</h2>\n<p>Horrors are supernatural entities. In the Old World, they were superstition and legend. Here, they are nightmares made real. The Ironlands is fertile ground for darkness and evil to take hold, spawning these undead beings of pure vengeance or mindless hate.</p>\n<p>Many horrors can be temporarily defeated through physical attacks, but cannot be killed. They are beyond death.</p>\n",
