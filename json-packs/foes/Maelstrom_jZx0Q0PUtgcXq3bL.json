The debris swept into the maelstrom’s heart batter armor and flesh. The voices of the maelstrom’s victims, ripped from their chests with their dying breaths, cry out from the turbulent water.</p>\n\n<div class=\"boxgroup flexrow boxrow\">\n  <div class=\"flexcol box\" style=\"justify-content: flex-start;\">\n    <h4 class=\"nogrow\" style=\"margin: 0.5em;\">Features</h4>\n    <p class=\"nogrow\">Whirling vortex of water</p>\n    <p class=\"nogrow\">Fierce currents</p>\n    <p class=\"nogrow\">Ghostly screams</p>\n  </div>\n  <div class=\"flexcol box\" style=\"justify-content: flex-start;\">\n    <h4 class=\"nogrow\" style=\"margin: 0.5em;\">Drives</h4>\n    <p class=\"nogrow\">Engulf victims</p>\n    <p class=\"nogrow\">Amass the voices of the lost</p>\n  </div>\n  <div class=\"flexcol box\" style=\"justify-content: flex-start;\">\n    <h4 class=\"nogrow\" style=\"margin: 0.5em;\">Tactics</h4>\n    <p class=\"nogrow\">Seize with raging, swirling waters</p>\n    <p class=\"nogrow\">Stun with numbing cold</p>\n    <p class=\"nogrow\">Batter with debris</p>\n    <p class=\"nogrow\">Drag into abyssal darkness</p>\n  </div>\n</div>\n\n<em><p>Within a waterway cutting through a <strong>Ravaged Icereach</strong>, a great maelstrom drew a longship and its crew into the depths.
