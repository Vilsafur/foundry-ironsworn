Some are animal-like, or combine the characteristics of different creatures. Others are bizarre aberrations seemingly born of chaos. A few even possess twisted mockeries of human features.</p>\n<p>They are rare beasts, but dwell in every region and environment of the Ironlands, from the dark waters of the Ragged Coast to the icy plains of the Shattered Wastes. Often, they protect ancient ruins, forgotten relics, and other secrets. They watch and wait, and show no mercy to those who trespass in their domain.</p>\n<p>We do not know the origin of the nightspawn. They are enigmatic creatures, rarely emerging from their dark lairs except during the long nights of winter. Is it the latent magic of these lands which gives them life? Have they passed through the veil from some other realm? Perhaps some questions are best left unanswered.</p>\n\n<div class=\"boxgroup flexrow boxrow\">\n  <div class=\"flexcol box\" style=\"justify-content: flex-start;\">\n    <h4 class=\"nogrow\" style=\"margin: 0.5em;\">Features</h4>\n    <p class=\"nogrow\">Mutated form (see the Monstrosity oracle on page 214)</p>\n  </div>\n  <div class=\"flexcol box\" style=\"justify-content: flex-start;\">\n    <h4 class=\"nogrow\" style=\"margin: 0.5em;\">Drives</h4>\n    <p class=\"nogrow\">Guard against intruders</p>\n    <p class=\"nogrow\">Lurk in the shadows</p>\n    <p class=\"nogrow\">Endure beyond memory</p>\n  </div>\n  <div class=\"flexcol box\" style=\"justify-content: flex-start;\">\n    <h4 class=\"nogrow\" style=\"margin: 0.5em;\">Tactics</h4>\n    <p class=\"nogrow\">Varied (see the Monstrosity oracle on page 214)</p>\n  </div>\n</div>\n\n<em><p>The first settlers, your forebears, told tales of a great nightspawn at the heart of a <strong>Ravaged Ruin</strong>.
