Their lairs are found in deep caves, subterranean vaults, or at the heart of dense forests. They hibernate in those places for weeks or months at a time, waking only to satiate their massive appetites. They are low-slung beasts, with short, thick legs, elongated jaws, and a dense hide.</p>\n<p>Fiercely territorial, a wyrm is sure to attack any who stray into their domain. It can sense movement through vibration, and its golden eyes can pierce the thickest darkness.</p>\n\n<div class=\"boxgroup flexrow boxrow\">\n  <div class=\"flexcol box\" style=\"justify-content: flex-start;\">\n    <h4 class=\"nogrow\" style=\"margin: 0.5em;\">Features</h4>\n    <p class=\"nogrow\">Enormous size</p>\n    <p class=\"nogrow\">Yellow eyes, bright as a torch</p>\n    <p class=\"nogrow\">Long, sinuous tail</p>\n    <p class=\"nogrow\">Scaled skin</p>\n    <p class=\"nogrow\">Cavernous mouth</p>\n  </div>\n  <div class=\"flexcol box\" style=\"justify-content: flex-start;\">\n    <h4 class=\"nogrow\" style=\"margin: 0.5em;\">Drives</h4>\n    <p class=\"nogrow\">Protect territory</p>\n    <p class=\"nogrow\">Kill and feed</p>\n  </div>\n  <div class=\"flexcol box\" style=\"justify-content: flex-start;\">\n    <h4 class=\"nogrow\" style=\"margin: 0.5em;\">Tactics</h4>\n    <p class=\"nogrow\">Tail smash</p>\n    <p class=\"nogrow\">Pin to the ground</p>\n    <p class=\"nogrow\">Savage claw and bite</p>\n  </div>\n</div>\n\n<em><p>Last year, a huge white wyrm destroyed several mining camps in the Veiled Mountains.

What is it, and what clans or factions seek to control it?</p></em>\n\n<h2>Beast</h2>\n<p>Beasts are monstrous creatures of great size and power.
