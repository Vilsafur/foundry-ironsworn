The stones hunger for new knowledge, and our memories are fodder for their insatiable appetites. What they take is sometimes gone forever.</p>\n<p>Some Ironlanders enter a circle willingly. Perhaps they hope to abandon a painful memory to the stones, discarding that piece of themselves like slag hammered from wrought iron. Then, there are those who wish to forsake the world and live with their memories. For them, an unreal life within the circle is better than the cruel reality outside of it.</p>\n<p>Those in need of information may choose to risk a negotiation within a circle. Knowledge for knowledge is the customary trade, but the stones are cunning and may demand a more horrible price.</p>\n\n<div class=\"boxgroup flexrow boxrow\">\n  <div class=\"flexcol box\" style=\"justify-content: flex-start;\">\n    <h4 class=\"nogrow\" style=\"margin: 0.5em;\">Features</h4>\n    <p class=\"nogrow\">Ancient stones, etched with mysterious symbols</p>\n    <p class=\"nogrow\">Whispers of old magic</p>\n    <p class=\"nogrow\">Visions of hoarded memories</p>\n  </div>\n  <div class=\"flexcol box\" style=\"justify-content: flex-start;\">\n    <h4 class=\"nogrow\" style=\"margin: 0.5em;\">Drives</h4>\n    <p class=\"nogrow\">Preserve age-old secrets</p>\n    <p class=\"nogrow\">Seek new knowledge</p>\n  </div>\n  <div class=\"flexcol box\" style=\"justify-content: flex-start;\">\n    <h4 class=\"nogrow\" style=\"margin: 0.5em;\">Tactics</h4>\n    <p class=\"nogrow\">Trap the unwary, and lure the desperate</p>\n    <p class=\"nogrow\">Extract painful memories</p>\n    <p class=\"nogrow\">Grant knowledge, for a price</p>\n  </div>\n</div>\n\n<em><p>A clan of Ironlanders protect and worship a circle of stones found in a Hallowed Tanglewood.
