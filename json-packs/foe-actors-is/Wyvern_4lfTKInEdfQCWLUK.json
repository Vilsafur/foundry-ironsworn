On the eastern coast, tawny wyverns nest in the cliffs of the Barrier Islands and Ragged Shore, diving for fish in the surrounding waters. Inland, the verdant wyverns dwell in forested regions. The largest and most fearsome breed, the iron wyverns, hunt among the Tempest Hills and along the flanks of the Veiled Mountains.</p>\n<p>All wyverns have wolfish heads with wide jaws, thick bodies, and sinuous tails. They have short hind limbs and elongated forelimbs which extend along their wings. In flight, they are a terrifying but awe-inspiring creature. On the ground, they lumber heavily on all four limbs, their wings folded back, jaws agape, gaze fixed on their prey.</p>\n<p>They are the grim cruelty of the Ironlands given form. They are death.</p>\n\n<div class=\"boxgroup flexrow boxrow\">\n  <div class=\"flexcol box\" style=\"justify-content: flex-start;\">\n    <h4 class=\"nogrow\" style=\"margin: 0.5em;\">Features</h4>\n    <p class=\"nogrow\">Huge bat-like wings</p>\n    <p class=\"nogrow\">Rows of teeth each the size of a knife</p>\n    <p class=\"nogrow\">Thick hide with a metallic sheen</p>\n    <p class=\"nogrow\">Long tail</p>\n  </div>\n  <div class=\"flexcol box\" style=\"justify-content: flex-start;\">\n    <h4 class=\"nogrow\" style=\"margin: 0.5em;\">Drives</h4>\n    <p class=\"nogrow\">Watch for prey from high above</p>\n    <p class=\"nogrow\">Feed</p>\n  </div>\n  <div class=\"flexcol box\" style=\"justify-content: flex-start;\">\n    <h4 class=\"nogrow\" style=\"margin: 0.5em;\">Tactics</h4>\n    <p class=\"nogrow\">Swoop down</p>\n    <p class=\"nogrow\">Snap up prey</p>\n    <p class=\"nogrow\">Fearsome roar</p>\n    <p class=\"nogrow\">Bash with tail</p>\n  </div>\n</div>\n\n<em><p>Ancient cave paintings in the Tempest Hills show humanoids riding atop wyverns.

Where is this supposedly located? In what way do Ironlanders make use of wyvern bones?</p></em>\n\n<h2>Beast</h2>\n<p>Beasts are monstrous creatures of great size and power. They are natural beings—not supernatural entities—but were unknown in the Old World.</p>\n",
