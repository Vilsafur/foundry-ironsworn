It is said that their loneliness compels them to draw living victims into their watery lairs.</p>\n<p>A sodden is not confined to its resting place. In fact, some believe that surviving an encounter with a sodden will leave you vulnerable around any body of water until the spirit finishes its work.</p>\n\n<div class=\"boxgroup flexrow boxrow\">\n  <div class=\"flexcol box\" style=\"justify-content: flex-start;\">\n    <h4 class=\"nogrow\" style=\"margin: 0.5em;\">Features</h4>\n    <p class=\"nogrow\">Milky eyes</p>\n    <p class=\"nogrow\">Mottled flesh</p>\n  </div>\n  <div class=\"flexcol box\" style=\"justify-content: flex-start;\">\n    <h4 class=\"nogrow\" style=\"margin: 0.5em;\">Drives</h4>\n    <p class=\"nogrow\">Drown the living</p>\n  </div>\n  <div class=\"flexcol box\" style=\"justify-content: flex-start;\">\n    <h4 class=\"nogrow\" style=\"margin: 0.5em;\">Tactics</h4>\n    <p class=\"nogrow\">Draw victims into the water</p>\n    <p class=\"nogrow\">Grab and scratch with jagged claws</p>\n    <p class=\"nogrow\">Chilling embrace</p>\n    <p class=\"nogrow\">Drag into the depths</p>\n  </div>\n</div>\n\n<em><p>Someone you know died and appears to you as a sodden.

What do they do? Is there any truth to this custom?</p></em>\n\n<h2>Horror</h2>\n<p>Horrors are supernatural entities. In the Old World, they were superstition and legend. Here, they are nightmares made real. The Ironlands is fertile ground for darkness and evil to take hold, spawning these undead beings of pure vengeance or mindless hate.</p>\n<p>Many horrors can be temporarily defeated through physical attacks, but cannot be killed. They are beyond death.</p>\n",
