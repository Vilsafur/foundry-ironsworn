They have long legs, a segmented tail, and large, serrated claws.</p>\n<p>Their carapace changes color to perfectly match their environment, making them nearly invisible among rocks or ice. When potential prey strays near, a shroud crab uses its powerful legs to spring at its victim. Then, it wraps around them in a horrible embrace, stabbing and slashing with its claws and barbed tail.</p>\n<p>Packs of shroud crabs are known to work in tandem to bring down large prey. Some report seeing mighty elk engulfed by these voracious creatures. On occasion, the body of a missing Ironlander is found with their flesh picked clean to the bones.</p>\n\n<div class=\"boxgroup flexrow boxrow\">\n  <div class=\"flexcol box\" style=\"justify-content: flex-start;\">\n    <h4 class=\"nogrow\" style=\"margin: 0.5em;\">Features</h4>\n    <p class=\"nogrow\">Ridged shell</p>\n    <p class=\"nogrow\">Snapping, slashing claws</p>\n    <p class=\"nogrow\">Barbed, whiplike tail</p>\n  </div>\n  <div class=\"flexcol box\" style=\"justify-content: flex-start;\">\n    <h4 class=\"nogrow\" style=\"margin: 0.5em;\">Drives</h4>\n    <p class=\"nogrow\">Lie hidden among rocks and ice</p>\n    <p class=\"nogrow\">Feed</p>\n  </div>\n  <div class=\"flexcol box\" style=\"justify-content: flex-start;\">\n    <h4 class=\"nogrow\" style=\"margin: 0.5em;\">Tactics</h4>\n    <p class=\"nogrow\">Mimic surroundings</p>\n    <p class=\"nogrow\">Leap at unsuspecting prey</p>\n    <p class=\"nogrow\">Latch onto victims with powerful legs and tail</p>\n    <p class=\"nogrow\">Stab and slash</p>\n  </div>\n</div>\n\n<em><p>A vengeful husk curses a seaside settlement and summons a horde of shroud crabs to overrun the place in a flood of clattering legs and snapping claws. The husk dwells within an <strong>Infested Sea Cave</strong>, protected by other shroud crabs. There, she prepares an even more horrible show of her power—one which will threaten villages up and down the Ragged Coast.</p></em>\n\n\n<h2>Animal</h2>\n<p>Animals are the mundane creatures which dwell in the Ironlands. Some animals are native to these lands; others were also common in the Old World.</p>\n<p>Most wild animals are skittish and do not pose a threat to humans. Those creatures have no rank, and can be attacked or interacted with using appropriate moves. For example, <em>Resupply</em> (page 63) can represent hunting for deer or small game.</p>\n<p>A few notable exceptions—predators, aggressive creatures, and animals trained to fight—are noted here.</p>\n",
