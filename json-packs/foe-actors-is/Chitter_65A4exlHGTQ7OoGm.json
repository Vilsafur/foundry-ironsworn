They stand half the height of an Ironlander, and move on six segmented legs.</p>\n<p>They are primarily scavengers, using their keen sense of smell to locate and retrieve carcasses above or below ground. Instead of eyes, chitters have three thumb-sized holes in the center of their heads through which they issue a distinctive twittering sound. This call is used to communicate with others of its kind and to help visualize their surroundings—much like bats find their way in darkness.</p>\n<p>They are covered in a rigid shell, and their mandibles are as sharp and destructive as a finely forged blade. They are not necessarily hostile, but will aggressively defend their nests or fight to secure a food source.</p>\n<p>As a last resort, a chitter may attack by spewing the contents of its stomach in a noxious spray, leaving all but the hardiest of Ironlanders temporarily blinded and retching.</p>\n\n<div class=\"boxgroup flexrow boxrow\">\n  <div class=\"flexcol box\" style=\"justify-content: flex-start;\">\n    <h4 class=\"nogrow\" style=\"margin: 0.5em;\">Features</h4>\n    <p class=\"nogrow\">Chitinous shell</p>\n    <p class=\"nogrow\">Snapping mandibles</p>\n  </div>\n  <div class=\"flexcol box\" style=\"justify-content: flex-start;\">\n    <h4 class=\"nogrow\" style=\"margin: 0.5em;\">Drives</h4>\n    <p class=\"nogrow\">Sniff out food</p>\n    <p class=\"nogrow\">Defend the nest</p>\n  </div>\n  <div class=\"flexcol box\" style=\"justify-content: flex-start;\">\n    <h4 class=\"nogrow\" style=\"margin: 0.5em;\">Tactics</h4>\n    <p class=\"nogrow\">Summon the horde</p>\n    <p class=\"nogrow\">Swarm and bite</p>\n    <p class=\"nogrow\">Spew putrid vomit</p>\n  </div>\n</div>\n\n<em><p>An Ironlander scavenged a relic from an <strong>Ancient Underkeep</strong>, bringing it back to their settlement.
