Possessions are discarded or turned over to the needs of the sect. They live for one purpose, and all other vows are forsaken. This single-minded devotion changes them, sometimes irrevocably.</p>\n<p>Some zealots worship ancient, forgotten gods, and seek to return them to their former horrible glory. Others serve new religious movements, caught up in promises of a better life. Some worship mortal leaders as if they were godsâ€”perhaps even believing them to be the avatar of divinity.</p>\n<p>This sense of belonging, of purpose, can be a powerful lure in this perilous land.</p>\n\n<div class=\"boxgroup flexrow boxrow\">\n  <div class=\"flexcol box\" style=\"justify-content: flex-start;\">\n    <h4 class=\"nogrow\" style=\"margin: 0.5em;\">Features</h4>\n    <p class=\"nogrow\">Sickly pallor</p>\n    <p class=\"nogrow\">Distant eyes</p>\n    <p class=\"nogrow\">Marks of their faith</p>\n  </div>\n  <div class=\"flexcol box\" style=\"justify-content: flex-start;\">\n    <h4 class=\"nogrow\" style=\"margin: 0.5em;\">Drives</h4>\n    <p class=\"nogrow\">Serve the faith</p>\n    <p class=\"nogrow\">Bring others into the fold</p>\n    <p class=\"nogrow\">Destroy those who oppose them</p>\n  </div>\n  <div class=\"flexcol box\" style=\"justify-content: flex-start;\">\n    <h4 class=\"nogrow\" style=\"margin: 0.5em;\">Tactics</h4>\n    <p class=\"nogrow\">Entice with trickery or false promises</p>\n    <p class=\"nogrow\">Use the powers of the faith</p>\n    <p class=\"nogrow\">Stand together to overcome nonbelievers</p>\n  </div>\n</div>\n\n<em><p>You have lost someone to an emerging sect which seeks to unleash a forgotten power or entity.
